In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also one additional input without a known output. Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.\n\nThe inputs and outputs are each \"grids\". A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers (ASCII). Each number corresponds to a color. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.\n\nThe transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the additional input. It doesn't need to work for all possible inputs.\n\nYou'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.\n\nAfter your reasoning write code in triple backticks (```python and then ```). You should write a function called `transform` which takes a single argument, the input grid as `list[list[int]]`, and returns the transformed grid (also as `list[list[int]]`). You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation which works in general (it shouldn't just work for the additional input).\n\nDon't write tests in your python code, just output the `transform` function. (It will be tested later.)\n\nYou can also ask question to verify your observation on the inputs/outputs patterns in the form of python function which takes two arguments, the input and expected output grid both as `list[list[int]]` and returns the boolean flag (True or False). We will help you by running your Python function on examples and let you know whether your question is True or False.\n\nYou follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.\n\nYou reason in substantial detail for as is necessary to determine the transformation rule.\n\nYou are creative and accomplished at solving puzzles. When you write `transform`, do not hardcode the solution for each example. We will run your transform function on additional inputs later and check if your logic is generic in addition to check the correctness.\n\nYour previous code:\n```\ndef transform(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replace every plus-shaped pattern of 4's with 8's.\n    A plus shape consists of a centre cell (value 4) that has\n    orthogonal neighbours (up, down, left, right) also equal to 4.\n    All five cells of each such pattern become 8.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not grid:\n        return []\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Set of positions (i, j) that must be turned into 8\n    to_change = set()\n\n    # Scan interior cells only (need all four neighbours)\n    for i in range(1, rows - 1):\n        for j in range(1, cols - 1):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Check the four orthogonal neighbours\n                if (grid[i-1][j] == 4 and\n                    grid[i+1][j] == 4 and\n                    grid[i][j-1] == 4 and\n                    grid[i][j+1] == 4):\n                    # Mark centre and its arms\n                    to_change.add((i, j))\n                    to_change.add((i-1, j))\n                    to_change.add((i+1, j))\n                    to_change.add((i, j-1))\n                    to_change.add((i, j+1))\n\n    # Build the output grid (deep copy)\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n\n    # Apply the change\n    for i, j in to_change:\n        result[i][j] = 8\n\n    return result\n```\n\nHere are the results based on the code above.\n# Example 0\n\nResult: Correct\n\n# Example 1\n\nResult: Correct\n\n# Example 2\n\nResult: Correct\n\n# Summary\n\nYour solution is correct for all the problems!\n\nAlso, here are the outputs of your `transform` function on additional inputs.
